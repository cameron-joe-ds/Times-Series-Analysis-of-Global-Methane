# Time Series Analysis of Global Methane

Following the Box-Jenkins methodology, methane data was processed through Box-Cox transformation and differencing before ACF/PACF analysis. Multiple candidate models were proposed, and the best model was selected by AICc and residual portmanteau tests. Finally, forecasting was conducted using the model and model predictive validity was evaluated.
